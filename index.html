            <p>Purchased a rod, reel, line, bobbers, live worms, hooks, powerbait and some synthetic bait at big 5. Wasn't really sure what I was doing. Reel 
			got jumpled so bad I had to cut it twice. Got a few meidum sized fish to eat the nightcrawlers off my tackle, but no hooks. </p>

    <p>Fish Caught: 0 panfish</p>
    <p>Weather: 89F - Sunny and warm</p>
    <p>Bait Used: Worms</p>
    <p>Today, I decided to visit Yarrow Point Beach Park to try my luck at catching perch. The weather was a lovely 89 degrees, and the sun was shining brightly. I brought along a new pole and rod setup, adding another option to my fishing arsenal. It's always exciting to have multiple setups ready for action!</p>
    <p>As I cast my line into the calm waters, I learned that perch are considered a type of "panfish," which means they're just the right size to fit inside a pan for cooking. Although I didn't manage to catch any fish today, I did feel multiple nibbles and bites from the smaller inhabitants of the lake.</p>
    <p>Even though the catch count remained at zero, I still enjoyed the serene surroundings and the thrill of feeling the fish interact with my bait. I'm determined to refine my techniques and hopefully have a successful perch catch next time!</p>

    <p>Went out with my Father, Brock, on his Boston Whaler fishing boat. We caught slamon in the salt water about 300 feet off the coast of the rundown port in endmond. This day, we saw
    porpuse, lots of salmon jumping, and fed the harbor seals.</p>

    <p>Liza and I tried to fish multiple lakes during the hot part of the day. No bites at all :( Met a nice fisher on a small water vessel named a Fish Cat. He recommended beaver lake for trout after they
    stock it in October. Pine lake and beaver lake were not great for shore fishing, at least at the public access. </p>

    <p>Finally! After many days of fishing for panfish, I finally caught multiple! I got both a perch and a sunfish about 15 feet off the shore on the eastside of Lake Sammamish. 
    Using a bobber, sinker and worm as well as just a worm on a hook. Time was 6:30-8:30 PM right through the sunset</p>

    <p>Weather: 67F - Cloudy w/ on and off rainstorms</p>
    <p>Bait Used: Real Worms, pink powerbait</p>
    <p>Today was amazing. Me and Lisa headed out around 5:30 PM and started fishing about 6:45, after getting dinner at Burgermaster. We grabbed the spot at the end of yarrow point, and 
    casted in powerbait and nightcrawlers, trying to fish right off the bottom without a bobber. Both baits had success, the powerbait got bigger fish but the worms got fish more often.
    We actually cleaned up today, getting 9 fish in about 2 hours. Killed one as it swallowed a hook. Lots of company at the end of the dock checking out the action we were making. </p>
