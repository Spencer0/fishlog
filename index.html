            <p>Purchased a rod, reel, line, bobbers, live worms, hooks, powerbait and some synthetic bait at big 5. Wasn't really sure what I was doing. Reel 
			got jumpled so bad I had to cut it twice. Got a few meidum sized fish to eat the nightcrawlers off my tackle, but no hooks. </p>

    <img src="./yarrow.jpg" alt="Fish Image" class="fish-image">
    <p>Location: Yarrow Point Beach Park</p>
    <p>Fish Caught: 0 panfish</p>
    <p>Weather: 89F - Sunny and warm</p>
    <p>Bait Used: Worms</p>
    <p>Today, I decided to visit Yarrow Point Beach Park to try my luck at catching perch. The weather was a lovely 89 degrees, and the sun was shining brightly. I brought along a new pole and rod setup, adding another option to my fishing arsenal. It's always exciting to have multiple setups ready for action!</p>
    <p>As I cast my line into the calm waters, I learned that perch are considered a type of "panfish," which means they're just the right size to fit inside a pan for cooking. Although I didn't manage to catch any fish today, I did feel multiple nibbles and bites from the smaller inhabitants of the lake.</p>
    <p>Even though the catch count remained at zero, I still enjoyed the serene surroundings and the thrill of feeling the fish interact with my bait. I'm determined to refine my techniques and hopefully have a successful perch catch next time!</p>

    <p>Bait Used: Artifical Worms</p>
    <p>Liza and I tried to fish multiple lakes during the hot part of the day. No bites at all :( Met a nice fisher on a small water vessel named a Fish Cat. He recommended beaver lake for trout after they
    stock it in October. Pine lake and beaver lake were not great for shore fishing, at least at the public access. </p>

    Using a bobber, sinker and worm as well as just a worm on a hook. Time was 6:30-8:30 PM right through the sunset</p>
